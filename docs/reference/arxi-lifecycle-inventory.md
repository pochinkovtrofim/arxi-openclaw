# Arxi lifecycle producer inventory

This is source-level upgrade evidence, not a stable OpenClaw API. Arxi consumes
only the versioned `gateway.suspend.*` protocol. The inventory was reviewed at
exact upstream commit `b576bb41cf4b3b3418a25e925d9b48ff6dd18c57`.

Active work is covered by the canonical Gateway snapshot in
`src/infra/gateway-active-work.ts` plus server-local inspectors in
`src/gateway/server-active-work.ts`:

- command queue and reply delivery;
- embedded agent runs and background exec sessions;
- cron runs, cron-owned watcher work, and registered tasks;
- Gateway root requests, session work admission, and session mutations;
- active or queued chat turns;
- terminal persistence and open terminal sessions.

External ingress reaches one of the root/session/queue/reply boundaries above;
prepared suspension closes that admission before inspection. Cron is the sole
reviewed time-based producer. Its enabled `at`, `every`, and `cron` schedules,
including persisted retry/backoff timestamps, converge on the scheduler's
canonical `nextWakeAtMs`.

At this pin the configured heartbeat monitor is a system-owned Automation in
the cron store. Cron owns its cadence, persisted due state, retry/backoff, busy
deferral, restart restoration, and next-wake projection. The remaining
`heartbeat-runner*` modules execute a due monitor turn and deliver its result;
they are not a second scheduler. Event-driven `on-exit`, stream, webhook, and
channel inputs are active blockers or external events and do not add another
time-based wake producer.

`gateway-lifecycle-inventory.test.ts` compares the declared active categories
with the canonical snapshot and pins the reviewed upstream merge. Any upstream
upgrade therefore fails until this inventory and the wake mapping are reviewed.
